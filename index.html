        <h3 class="about-section__secondary-heading">The Bees Knees</h3>
        <p class="about-section__description">The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating 
            from San Francisco, California. The band 
            consists a dynamic lineup featuring two lead 
            vocalists, two guitarists, a bassist, a 
            keyboardist and a drummer. The band 
            achieved its first commercial success as an 
            unsigned act, drawing attention from their 
            future manager. Having extensive experience 
            working with both new and seasoned acts, the 
            manager was confident the band could 
            succeed even further with more support, 
            pushing The Bees Knees to sign with a well 
            known record label.
        </p>
        <p class="about-section__description">From there, the band has soared, gaining 
            international recognition and ranking in the 
            top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans 
            immediately fell in love with the band’s original 
            and organic attitude, solidifying their place as 
            one of the hottest and fastest up and coming 
            acts of this century. Fans affectionately refer to 
            themselves as “The Hive” and are drawn to 
            their candid and authentic performances on 
            stage. The Bees Knees are currently recording 
            their second studio album, looking to be 
            released in early 2024.
